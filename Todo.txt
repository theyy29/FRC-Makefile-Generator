add support for relative paths here!

The reason why the project name is nessasary is beacuse it is frequented throughout the makefile.

Does there really have to be case sensitivity on linux? or not on all others? or am I just finding an extra use for the OS stuff

And does there really need to be os.h or can it all just use the qt stuff?

Change the 'projects-dir' mess

Arguments:
 --config=/path/file
